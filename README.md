## 🧐 What?
"Unstructured Data Analysis and Modelling" is an attempt to process, analyze and build Machine Learning models for data that is not structured and tabular. The data are in text, image, and audio formats.

## 🤷 Why?  
Business digitization has increased the amount of data available within organizations. Firms and managers are now tasked with extracting insights from these new and expanding data sources. Challenges arise when we consider the nature of these new digital forms of data. One issue is that data is becoming increasingly unstructured (e.g., text, visual, and audio data), necessitating different methods of analysis than traditional (structured) data forms. Aside from that, it is unclear how we can use this data in day-to-day business operations. Firms and managers can benefit from new insights only when we can process these data and link them to business-relevant outcomes.

## 🧱 Structure?
This repository contains 4 folders:
- **data**, including:
    + raw (external data, and primary data in their rawest formats)
    + temp (temporary data sets which only function to support data processing decisions)
    + processed (filtered selected data based on study scope, study goals and data processing trials)
    + final (the data set ready for modelling)
- **src**, including:
    + final-data-processing-and-modelling (main data processing and modelling codes)
- **deliverables**, including:
    + project-summary (the final defense in which I summarize the whole project)  
    > **Note**

    <em>Average occupancy at any point of time per 30 minutes</em>
</p>

In summary, the project has succeeded in detecting and estimating the number of occupants with high accuracy. Regarding occupancy detection, most of the models return an accuracy around 80% to 90%, which is acceptable for a large room. As for the occupancy classification, the best model reach the accuracy of 70% for every 2-minute observation, even better than other models with more indoor and outdoor variables as well as contextual information.

- **Academic contributions**: The study provides a big primary dataset of occupancy, indoor air, and outdoor atmosphere. It applies insights from theories and studies on occupancy detection to a modern indoor space.  
- **Practical contributions**: The evidence of obtaining occupancy detection and classification model has been provided. Also, the study points out key issues that might help the process of developing this application.

On a more personal note, the project has received positive feedback from examiners and supervisors. Here are some of the remarks:
 > "**Fantastic work and very independent study** with detailed analysis on multiple aspects of indoor quality." 

 > "**Brilliant and precise, very professional** presentation, relevant results and smart research framework development."

## 🪁 Future?
More information about ventilation detection is required for getting the exact number in the long term.
